<h3><p>The First World War (1914–18), which caused instability in Europe, prepared the continent for World War II, which was instigated two decades later and was far more destructive. Adolf Hitler, the head of the Nazi Party, came to power in a politically and economically unsteady Germany. To further his goals of world dominance, he rearmed the country and negotiated strategic agreements with Italy and Japan. After Hitler invaded Poland in September 1939, France and Great Britain decided to declare war on Germany, starting World War II. More lives would be lost and more land and property would be destroyed during the following six years of fighting than during any other war in history. Six million Jews were among the estimated 45–60 million people who perished.</p></h3>
