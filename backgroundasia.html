        <h2> Asia </h2>
        <p>
            In the middle of the 1920s, the Chinese Kuomintang party undertook a campaign to unite the country against local warlords, but it quickly found itself at war with its erstwhile friends in the Chinese Communist Party. The Mukden Incident was staged in 1931 as a cover for an invasion of Manchuria and the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo by an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia. 
            In order to avert the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, China appealed to the League of Nations. When Japan's invasion of Manchuria was criticised, it left the League of Nations. After then, until the Tanggu Truce was reached in 1933, the two countries engaged in a number of conflicts in Shanghai, Rehe, and Hebei. Following that, Chinese volunteer forces kept up their defence against Japanese invasion in Manchuria, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Following the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and communist forces decided to put up a united front against Japan by calling a ceasefire.
