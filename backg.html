        <h2> Europe </h2>
        <p> With the defeat of the Central Powers, the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and the establishment of the Soviet Union, World War I fundamentally transformed the political landscape of Europe. The World War I Allies acquired territory in the meantime. The League of Nations was established during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference in order to avert another world war. After World War I, there was a strong pacifist attitude, but at the same time, irredentist and revanchist nationalism arose in a number of European governments. Because of the huge territorial, colonial, and financial losses brought on by the Treaty of Versailles, these sentiments were particularly strong in Germany. Germany lost around 13% of its domestic land as a result of the treaty, and its size and power were constrained.
            Reparations were demanded, and restrictions on the country's armed forces' size and power were put in place.
            During the German Revolution of 1918â€“1919, the German Empire was dismantled and a democratic government was established. Hardline opponents and new republic supporters clashed during the interwar era. Italian nationalists were incensed that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to guarantee Italy's admission into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement, despite the fact that Italy, as an Entente partner, had secured some post-war territorial gains. With a nationalist, authoritarian, and class-collaborative programme that eliminated representative democracy and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy, the fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized control of Italy from 1922 to 1925, claiming to establish a "New Roman Empire".
