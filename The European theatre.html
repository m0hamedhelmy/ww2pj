Poland was the target of Hitler's long-planned invasion because Great Britain and France had promised to defend it if Germany ever attacked. Hitler would not have to fight on two fronts after he invaded Poland thanks to the agreement with Stalin, and the Soviet Union would help him conquer and partition the country. Hitler invaded Poland on September 1st, 1939; two days later, France and Britain declared war on Germany, sparking the start of World War II.</font>

        <font face="Lato" color="#E5E4E2" size="4">Poland was attacked by Soviet forces from the east on September 17. Poland was swiftly overrun by both sides, and by the start of 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union had shared the country's control, in accordance with a covert protocol added to the Nonaggression Pact. Then, during the Russo-Finnish War, Stalin's forces advanced to conquer the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). The absence of action on the part of Germany and the Allies in the west during the six months after the invasion of Poland prompted speculation in the news media of a "fake war." However, a bloody sea battle between the British and German navies took place, and deadly German U-boat submarines attacked British merchant shipping, sinking over 100 vessels in the first 4 months.</font>

        <font face="Lato" color="#E5E4E2" size="4">Germany simultaneously invaded Norway and captured Denmark on April 9, 1940, sparking the start of the war. On May 10, German forces launched a "blitzkrieg," or rapid war, that raced across Belgium and the Netherlands. Three days later, German soldiers crossed the Meuse River and attacked French troops at Sedan, which was at the northern tip of the Maginot Line, a complex network of fortifications built after World War I and regarded as an impregnable defensive line. In actuality, the Germans destroyed the line by piercing it with their tanks and bombers and continuing to the rear. In the latter part of May, the French forces in the south put up a vain resistance while the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was evacuated from Dunkirk by sea.<br/>With France on the point of disintegrating, Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy, joined forces with Hitler in the Pact of Steel and on June 10 declared war on both France and Britain.

            German forces occupied Paris on June 14; two nights later, an armistice proposal was made by the new administration led by Marshal Philippe Petain, the World War I hero of France. Following this, France was split into two regions, one under German military control and the other under Petain's administration, which was established at Vichy France. In order to provide himself a defensive advantage, Hitler now focused on Britain, which was geographically isolated from the Continent by the English Channel. </font>

            <font face="Lato" color="#E5E4E2" size="4">German aircraft heavily bombed Britain from September 1940 to May 1941, a period known as the Blitz, including night raids on London and other industrial centres that resulted in significant civilian casualties and property damage. This bombardment was done to prepare for an amphibious invasion known as Operation Sea Lion. Hitler delayed his invasion preparations when the Royal Air Force (RAF) eventually beat the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) in the Battle of Britain. Prime Minister Winston Churchill started receiving essential assistance from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act, which Congress passed in early 1941, as Britain's defensive capabilities were being taxed to their maximum capacity.</font>

                <font face="Lato" color="#E5E4E2" size="4"> Early in 1941, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria joined the Axis, and in April of that year, German forces occupied Yugoslavia and Greece. Hitler's conquest of the Balkans served as a prelude to his true goal, an invasion of the Soviet Union, whose vast territory would provide the "Lebensraum" required by the German master race. Hitler's plan also included eradicating all Jews from the regions of Europe that Germany had seized. Around the time of the Soviet advance, plans for the "Final Solution" were unveiled, and over the course of the following three years, more than 4 million Jews would perish in the death camps established in occupied Poland.

                    Hitler gave the command to invade the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. Despite having a vastly greater number of tanks and planes than the Germans, Russian aviation technology was mainly outmoded, and the impact of the surprise invasion enabled the Germans to be within 200 miles of Moscow by the middle of July. The next German push was delayed due to disputes between Hitler and his generals until October, when it was halted by a Soviet counteroffensive and the arrival of severe winter weather.</font>
