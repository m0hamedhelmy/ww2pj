            Following a failed coup attempt against the German government in 1923, Adolf Hitler was ultimately elected Chancellor of Germany in. He did away with democracy and immediately started a protracted rearmament drive. Italy wanted Ethiopia as a colonial colony, but France gave it to them freely in exchange for their alliance. Early in 1935, when the Territory of the Saar Basin was formally reunited with Germany, the situation became worse. At the same time, Hitler renounced the Treaty of Versailles, increased his rearmament programme, and instituted conscription.

            In an important step toward military globalisation, the Stresa Front was established in April 1935 by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy to restrain Germany. However, in June of that same year, the United Kingdom forged an independent naval pact with Germany, loosening previous limits. Concerned about Germany's objectives, the Soviet Union drafted a convention of mutual cooperation with France. However, it had to go through the League of Nations' bureaucracy before going into force, therefore giving it no teeth. The Neutrality Act was passed by the US in August of the same year because it was worried about what was happening in Europe and Asia.
            By remilitarizing the Rhineland in March 1936, Hitler broke the terms of the Versailles and Locarno Treaties. Because of the appeasement strategy, he faced little resistance.

Germany and Italy established the Rome-Berlin Axis in October 1936. Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact a month later; Italy followed a year later.
